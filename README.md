# Prophet-Challenge
In this assignment we're taking on the role of an analyst at MercadoLibre. MercadoLibre is a popular e-commerce site that is located in Latine America. We were tasked with finding patterns in hourly Google search traffic. We used different functions like sort.index and loc to look at specific months. We used groupby and index.isocalandar and then plot our findings. Toward the end of the challenge we use a new function called Prophet to predict what trends MercadoLibre will have in the future.
